// adding the new environment to jupyter notebook 

first go to the environment you are adding and then
conda install -c anaconda ipykernel 
python -m ipykernel install --user --name=cairo
// craete environment with access to all system-wide packages/ I did this because cairo didn't work on my mac
python3 -m venv --system-site-package path/to/env

//Tk doesn't work with ipykernel version>4.10
conda install ipykernel=4.10

// see the list of jupyter notebook environments 
jupyter kernelspec list

//I had an error after installing the new environment the jupyter notebook failed with 
// the error : win32api I ran the following command
//installing it via python solved  the problem. 
>pip install pywin32
